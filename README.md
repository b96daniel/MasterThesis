This repo contains the codebase and documentation for my master's thesis, titled "Intelligent Decision Optimization System for Agile Scrum
Project Management" and written in 2021.
The project is about an AI/ML based effort estimation tool for agile software development. It essentially introduces a possible useful application of Large Language Models.
Throughout the thesis, I compared two different apporaches to solve the problem: (1) a legacy LSTM-based language model, and (2) state-of-the-art (in 2020-2021) Transformer-based LLMs like BERT, DeBERTa, RoBERTa.

Legacy solution: "DEEP-SE" folder
LLM solution:  "BERT" folder
